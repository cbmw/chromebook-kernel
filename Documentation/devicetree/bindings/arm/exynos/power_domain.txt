* Samsung Exynos Power Domains

Exynos processors include support for multiple power domains which are used
to gate power to one or more peripherals on the processor.

Required Properties:
- compatible: should be one of the following.
    * samsung,exynos4210-pd - for exynos4210 type power domain.
- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
    region.
- clocks: List of clock handles. The parent clocks of the input clocks to the
  devices in this power domain are set to oscclk before power gating and
  restored back after powering on a domain. This is required for all domains
  which are powered on and off and not required for unused domains.
  Some devices also have a divider block (CLKDIV2) which provides a second input
  clock. This divider register is a mirror register of the actual register
  inside the ip's domain which gets reset when the power domain is turned off.
  So the CLKDIV2 register needs to be reconfigured upon power on so that the
  internal regisger gets updated correctly. This is done by first setting the
  clock rate to its parent's clock rate and then setting back the original
  clock rate.
  The following clocks can be specified:
  - oscclk: oscillator clock.
  - clk(n): input clock to the devices in this power domain
  - pclk(n): parent clock of input clock to the devices in this power domain
  - dclk(n): second input clock to the devices which is divided by CLKDIV2
	     block.
- enable: enable value of this register which is used to turn on the power
    domain. If no enable is specificed, default value of 0x7 is used.

Node of a device using power domains must have a samsung,power-domain property
defined with a phandle to respective power domain.

Example:

	lcd0: power-domain-lcd0 {
		compatible = "samsung,exynos4210-pd";
		reg = <0x10023C00 0x10>;
	};

	mfc_pd: pd@10044060 {
		compatible = "samsung,exynos4210-pd";
		reg = <0x10044060 0x20>;
		clocks = <&clock 1>, <&clock 1030>, <&clock 1031>,
			 <&clock 2049>;
		clock-names = "oscclk", "pclk0", "clk0" , "dclk0";
	};

	isparm_pd: pd@10042480 {
		compatible = "samsung,exynos4210-pd";
		reg = <0x10042480 0x20>;
		enable = <0x1>;
	};

Example of the node using power domain:

	node {
		/* ... */
		samsung,power-domain = <&lcd0>;
		/* ... */
	};
